Characters can:
 choose their position depending on song
 modify the camera's initial position depending on song
 (which is always the opponent's graphics midpoint)

Stages can:
 modify the opponent's, gf's and player's position,
 depending on what the damn player/gf/etc is. This effectively places character knowledge in
 the stages themselves, so will need to make some kind of compromise/decoupling there.

How about?
Each stage has anchor points, say, the lower left corner of a character.
Characters then have to supply an offset to that anchor point which is their business since
you know, it's their spritesheet, and can thus get a controlled position across all stages?
This mechanism could also be supplied with the stage name, so the characters could behave
differently on a certain stage if they must.
^ If done this way, you could seamlessly drop in pico for daddy dearest for example and have them
  be positioned properly despite the height difference. This is probably what psych engine meant
  to do with the character position arrays now that i think about it. What an insane revelation,
  oh man.
As for camera control:
In the base game, it is only ever dependant on the opponent's position or the stage (well,
and that one time it needs to know whether story mode is active or not, but that's still stage
business.)
It would still be useful if characters could supply something like (RELATIVE, (123, 321)) or
(ABSOLUTE, (100, 100)) to control the initial position of the camera, as well as their
focus point during gameplay, which is something that will have to be modifiable for sure.

all values in "ini_cam" add the opponent's graphical midpoint without the opponent's actual world
position + (100, 100), unless the cell is marked with `$`. In that case it's "opp" instead of
(100, 100).
all values in "opp_cam" add the opponent's regular midpoint.
all values in "bf_cam" add bf's regular midpoint.
"regular midpoint" just means width/2, height/2. "graphical midpoint" means the same, except
width and height are those of the currently displayed frame's.

*only if story mode, for some reason
^Change made depending on the character in this song
'Change made depending on the stage string of this song
!Change made depending on the song's name
$See remark on "opp_cam" above.

Treating 100,100 as some default coordinate that stages then build around and characters
position themselves around with a disgusting hardcode-relation between songs/stages is idiotic.
The default camera coordinate should be stage-based.
The default character coordinates should also be.
fnf's standard formula is: opponent left. bf right. gf somewhere inbetween.
This means, bf's+gf's anchors would be fitting to always be lower left, and the opponent's to be
lower right. This way, even when swapping out characters, the distance between them remains.

// === //

how would you like to integrate characters?
think of something moderately complex like QT/KB
yeah, how would those work?

// Character code probably limited to the standard, really:
class QT(Character):
	def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
		super().__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

		self.frames = load_frames("characters/qt.xml")
		self.load_offsets()

		self.add_animation("idle", "Final_Idle", tags=(TAG_IDLE,), fps=18)
		self.add_animation("sing_up", "Final_Up", (22, -135), (TAG_SING,), 14)
		...

	// on_sing function instead of the game loop going .animation.play(f"sing_{dir}") ?
	// Makes a lot more sense as augmenting the game loop will localize the effect to certain
	// stages only.
	def on_sing(direction: NOTE_TYPE) -> None:
		n = f"sing_{direction.name}_alt" if randint(0, 19) == 0 else f"sing_{direction.name}"
		self.animation.play(n)

// Q: Could this be data-driven(TM)?
// A: Kinda, but only in a really limited fashion. Think of pico where it already breaks down
// having to accomodate stuff like "flip_x"
// Plus, going through with that will mean having to supply the data externally/through the
// constructor, which will make the character data non-inheritable anymore, but i doubt that
// was gonna be useful anytime soon. Should prolly get rid of that weirdness.
// [addendum 1] ^ Done.
// This change makes it possible at least to shred the current leaves off the base game's
// character tree as those could now all be replaced purely with data dicts. (But will still need
// coupling to specific subclasses (FlipIdleCharacter, Boyfriend), and use stuff like the HairMixin)

CharacterData:
 [new] positioning: t.Tuple[FocusStrategy, Vec2]

BaseScene:
 get_default_layers => get_layer_names()
 get_default_cameras => get_camera_names()

 Transitions? Probably should be moved there as well.

MusicBeatScene:
 introduces pretty much nothing relevant to the kernel. maaaybe the bpm, but nah.

InGameScene:
 // Should be coupled to the stage, anything else makes little sense.
 get_default_cam_zoom -> float
 [new] default_cam_zoom -> float

 [new] initial_camera_focus: t.Optional[Tuple[FocusStrategy], Vec2]
 [new] player_anchor/opponent_anchor/gf_anchor: CharacterAnchor

 // Interacted with only in the actual rhythm processing part of the game loop.
 // Ugly coupling to the scene as it also contains the notes' sprites.
 create_note_handler -> AbstractNoteHandler
 // Interacted with only ^ above and in the countdown.
 // The HUD is rather dependant on the basic cornerstones FNF sets; 2 strumrows à 4 notes each.
 // These two could be hyper-dynamicised into some kind of system that at its core is just a song
 // Position tracker/Keyframe system for the essential "expecting input around x", which is what
 // rhythm games are. But do not bother with that now.
 create_hud -> HUD

 // Make relatively dynamic just like in the actual modding engines so it does not need to be
 // overridden as much in stage subclasses.
 // Probably do not bother with multiple characters in the same category for now.
 // Unless gf, maybe? She still is special as in reacts to combo loss, but it would make
 // sense to create some kind of generic "stupidly reacts to beat hits at the given phase with the

Scene kernels!
They could hold data relating to scenes without actually being one.
It would kinda duplicate stuff and create coupling between classes but it would prevent
scenes being in an illegal pre-setup-call state, which is what HaxeFlixel <6.0 still has.
Ultimately we'd require some kind of PNFSceneData, not LevelData, which should i.e. only be the
same when given to TutorialScene. This should be the home for the stuff related to the
scene which was previously in these ugly-ass static get methods, so character positions as well as
the initial camera zoom, and the new initial camera positioning.
This would ultimately make the !code bodies! of SceneKernels the scene registry then.*
Also, definitely create a base SceneKernel with the camera and layer names.
*If this turns out to be annoying, see about creating an actual scene registry instead; this would
however maybe make SceneKernels useless again and justify another simpler structure to pass to
the push|set_scene methods.
^
Outdated again; Technically there are three types of data:
 - Scene-specific data, which should only ever be passed to one precise subclass. This is the
   default cam zoom, the layer and camera names and more.
   The subclasses generate this in their `__init__` methods and stuff it into the kernel, filling
   in defaults along the way.
 - Scene-driving data; parameters which influence how the scene operates. There are none by default,
   but the InGameScene specifies a bunch (level data etc.)
 - Superdata; the `Game` reference and not much else (ok technically this could kinda belong to
   "Scene-driving data" as well, but shut up)

// Usage/mockup i guess idk //

Decision needs to be made:
 game.push_scene(Level3SceneKernel(init_param))
 -requires a kernel for each scene subclass. No.
 game.push_scene(Level3Scene.get_kernel(init_param))
 -Overriding class- and static methods/fields is legal, but i'm trying to avoid it.
  There isn't a way around it with this entire system though, still way better than the overridden
  methods before.
 game.push_scene(lambda k: Level3Scene(k, level_data))
 -HaxeFlixel's new way of doing it.
  Not toooo bad tbh; stuffs the dynamic parameters away into a lambda closure and takes away the
  kernel's responsibility for keeping them.
  Does not communicate kernel type. however it removes the scene-driving data from it; so may
  honestly make subclassing kernels useless.
 -Makes it impossible for `on_imminent_replacement` to identify the replacing scene type, though
  it is unlikely anyone was gonna use that anyways.
Decision made: get_kernel. I find it pretty annoying to create a lambda every time you want to
create a scene; though you could certainly argue `get_kernel` is just as weird.

Decision needs to be made:
 Have the SceneKernel call `setup` in `create_scene` for a two-stage setup?
 Pros:
 -Subclasses can always call super().__init__ first; otherwise `setup` will run before those finish,
  requiring creation of attributes before init, which irks me a lot.
 -SceneKernel does not need to transport InGameScene specific default values anymore; they can just
  be set by subclasses post-super().__init__
 Cons:
 -Technically introduces a zombie state where the scene has been inited but many important objects
  don't exist, which i am trying to avoid

 Have pretty much everything happen as a direct consequence of __init__?
 Pros:
 - Does not have the zombie state as defined above
 Cons:
 -`setup` runs before subclasses' __init__ methods finish; meaning that all subclasses will need
  to communicate their default values through the kernel before calling into super().__init__ and
  setup all attribute shells at that point as well.
A decision has been made: Abolish setup into __init__, transfer scene-specific data through the
kernel and call functions that do not create more objects, but rather adjust and operate on them
(load_song, ready) from outside/the kernel
