Things a mod should be able to add:
  - Weeks
   - Songs, duh
  - Characters
  - Stages
  - Gameplay options -> (different savefile, probably)

^ All of this should be somehow baked into a modding system in `core`.

Pull a Teardown and differentiate between content and global mods?
 Global mods would be able to only add more assets or whatever to be used by other mods.
  - Would put heavy stress on asset system since basically everything needs to be turned
    into an asset. Unsure whether that is a good idea.
 Content mods would be able to completely override the base game/introduce custom main menus etc.

data mod:
- can only act limited by supplying json and pngs in predefined patters that pnf then loads
  in as weeks or so.
- either steal from psych engine or add a compatability for it i guess.
code mod:
- able to fully subvert the game by defining arbitrary python code running as freely as all
  other game code
- still needs a small entry point script of course.
 - when active, could define a totally different starting scene, overtaking the game fundamentally.
- unsafe. nothing stops some creepypasta modder from posting all your images on twitter and then
  deleting your home directory. (but it's ok the blue hedgehog with red eyes variant does it in the
  story it's immersive)
